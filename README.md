# Final Project

Current Progress:
- Initialized the directories for the project and setup the React + ViteExpress configurations
- Modifed server.improved.js to call the Sports API and get the current NBA, NFL, and MLB teams playing today
- Modified App.jsx to display the current teams playing
- Integrated MongoDB (doesn't do anything with it yet)


Things still needed:
- Auth0 integration and login page
- MongoDB database that keeps track of the user's current money, active bets, and previous history of bets such as: what teams competed, how much money you won or lost
- Display balance on the frontend in the right hand corner
- UI that is cleaner and allow users to choose which team they think will win and how much to bet
